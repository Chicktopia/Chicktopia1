# Chicktopia - Web-Based Chicken Game

## Project Overview
Chicktopia is a delightful web-based chicken raising game featuring an innovative "Earthen Claymorphism" design aesthetic. The game allows players to hatch, raise, and care for virtual chickens in a soft, tactile, clay-like visual environment.

- Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion
- Warm, earthy tones with subtle gradients
